== Devpay

This Devpay plugin is designed to ease integration with 
{Amazon's DevPay}[http://www.amazon.com/DevPay-AWS-Service-Pricing/b/ref=sc_fe_l_3?ie=UTF8&node=342429011] 
services, specifically for web-hosted DevPay products.

DevPay products for the desktop will very likely not find this plugin terribly 
useful.  Sorry.
